1. **Contract Definition:** The `PepesOfTheGalaxyNFT` contract is an ERC721 token contract with added AccessControl functionality from OpenZeppelin library.

2. **Struct Definition:** The `PepeMetadata` struct is defined to hold three attributes for each token: appearance, accessories, and experience.

3. **Mappings:** A public mapping `tokenMetadata` is declared, with key as the token ID and the value as the corresponding `PepeMetadata`.

4. **Constructor:** The constructor function is responsible for setting the token name and symbol, and assigning the deployer as the default admin role.

5. **Mint Function:** The `mintPepe` function creates a new token, stores the token metadata, emits a NewPepe event, and transfers the paid MATIC to the Gnosis

 multisig wallet. This function requires a payment of 50 MATIC to be called.

6. **GetPepeAttributes Function:** This function allows anyone to query the attributes of a token using its ID.

7. **AddExperience Function:** This function updates the experience of a token. The function is protected by the Access Control mechanism so that only addresses with the `EXPERIENCE_UPDATER_ROLE` can call this function.

8. **EXPERIENCE_UPDATER_ROLE:** This role is introduced for access control. Any address with this role is allowed to call the `addExperience` function.

9. **Role Setup:** The contract deployer is set as the default admin role during contract deployment. This allows the deployer to further manage the roles (like granting the `EXPERIENCE_UPDATER_ROLE` to certain addresses).
